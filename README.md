## 📘 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

### **Essay Questions**

#### **Q1. Edge AI vs Cloud-Based AI**

Explain how **Edge AI** reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to traditional **cloud-based AI** systems.
Include a **real-world example**, such as **autonomous drones** performing object detection and navigation in real time without depending on constant cloud connectivity.

#### **Q2. Quantum AI vs Classical AI**

Compare **Quantum AI** and **Classical AI** in solving **optimization problems**.
Discuss potential advantages and limitations of each, and highlight **industries** (e.g., logistics, finance, pharmaceuticals) that could benefit most from **Quantum AI** innovations.
