Smart Intrusion Detection System - Analysis & Deployment Report
Executive Summary
This report evaluates the SmartIntrusionDetector system, a statistical anomaly detection solution for identifying potential security intrusions based on sensor readings. The system uses z-score analysis to flag unusual activity patterns.
System Overview
Architecture
The detector implements a supervised learning approach using statistical methods:

Training Phase: Learns normal behavior patterns from historical sensor data
Detection Phase: Identifies anomalies using z-score threshold analysis
Monitoring Phase: Continuous real-time evaluation with alerting capabilities

Key Components

Learning Module: Calculates mean and standard deviation from training samples
Detection Engine: Computes z-scores and flags anomalies exceeding sensitivity threshold
Monitoring System: Real-time sensor polling with callback integration

Accuracy Metrics & Performance Analysis
Current Configuration

Sensitivity Threshold: 3.0 (z-score)
Training Sample Size: 100 readings
Normal Distribution: μ ≈ 5.0, σ ≈ 1.0
Monitoring Interval: 0.5-1.0 seconds

Statistical Performance Metrics
1. Detection Accuracy
Based on the z-score threshold of 3.0:

True Negative Rate (Specificity): ~99.7% for normal readings

Readings within 3σ are correctly classified as normal


False Positive Rate: ~0.3% under normal Gaussian distribution

Type I error: legitimate activity flagged as intrusion



2. Sensitivity Analysis
Current threshold at z=3.0 provides:

Detection of readings >3 standard deviations from mean
For μ=5, σ=1: Flags readings <2 or >8
Simulated intrusions (12-20 range): z-scores of 7-15 (100% detection)

3. Expected Performance Metrics
Based on simulation parameters:

Intrusion Rate: 5% of readings (simulated)
True Positive Rate: ~100% (intrusions at 12-20 are 7-15σ from mean)
Precision: >94% (assuming minimal false positives)
Recall: ~100% (all simulated intrusions exceed threshold)

Limitations & Risks

Distribution Assumptions: Assumes Gaussian distribution of normal behavior
Static Thresholds: No adaptation to changing baseline patterns
Cold Start Problem: Requires representative training data
Drift Vulnerability: Performance degrades if normal patterns evolve
Single Feature Detection: Uses only one sensor reading type
TensorFlow Import Issue: Line 5 imports tensorflow as TFlite but never uses it

Deployment Steps
Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation
1.1 Data Collection (Week 1-2)
Objective: Gather representative normal operation data
- Collect minimum 500-1000 sensor readings during normal conditions
- Ensure data covers all typical operational scenarios:
  * Different times of day
  * Weekdays vs. weekends
  * Various occupancy levels
  * Environmental variations
- Store data in CSV format with timestamps
- Validate data quality (no gaps, outliers, or errors)
1.2 Baseline Calibration (Week 3)
Tasks:
1. Analyze collected data distribution
2. Calculate optimal sensitivity threshold:
   - Start with 3.0 (default)
   - Test with 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 on validation set
   - Balance false positives vs. detection rate
3. Document baseline statistics
4. Create calibration report
1.3 Code Refinements
python# Remove unused import

logging.basicConfig(
    filename='intrusion_detector.log',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

        'mean': self._mean,
        'std': self._std,
        'sensitivity': self.sensitivity
    }
    with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(model_data, f)

def load_model(self, filepath):
    """Load learned parameters from file"""
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        model_data = json.load(f)
    self._mean = model_data['mean']
    self._std = model_data['std']
    self.sensitivity = model_data['sensitivity']

    """Production alert system"""
    # Email notification
    import smtplib
    send_email_alert(reading, z)
    
    # Log to database
    log_to_database(reading, z, timestamp=time.time())
